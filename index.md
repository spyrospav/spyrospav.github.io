Hi! I'm Spyros Pavlatos and I am a fourth year PhD student at University of Pennsylvania advised by [Vincent Liu](https://vincen.tl/). I'm also a proud member of [PLClub](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/)!
{:.lead}

My research interests are focused around Programming Languages, Compilers and Distributed Systems. More specifically, I am interested in using PL and Compiler techniques to speed up applications on serverless platforms, while maintaining correctness.

Before joining Penn, I completed my undergraduate studies at National Technical University of Athens under the supervision of [Kostis Sagonas](https://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/). My undergraduate [thesis](http://artemis.cslab.ece.ntua.gr:8080/jspui/bitstream/123456789/18415/1/thesis.pdf) was focused on developing a test suite for model checking Persistent Memory programs.
