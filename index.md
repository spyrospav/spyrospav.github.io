Hi! I'm Spyros Pavlatos and I am an first year PhD student at University of Pennsylvania advised by [Rajeev Alur](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~alur/). I'm also a proud member of [PLClub](https://www.cis.upenn.edu/~plclub/)!

My research interests are focused around Programming Languages and Distributed Systems. More specifically, I am interested in verification techniques and programming abstractions for distributed applications.

Before joining Penn, I completed my undergraduate studies at National Technical University of Athens under the supervision of [Kostis Sagonas](https://user.it.uu.se/~kostis/). My undergraduate thesis was focused on developing a test suite for model checking Persistent Memory programs.
